1. PSTH Analysis

Objective:

- Compute Peri-Stimulus Time Histograms (PSTHs) during the delay phase ([-150, 50] ms) using a Gaussian kernel.
- Compare neural activity trends across reward levels.

Required Data Fields:

spiketimesdiff: Neural spike times.
params: To group trials by reward conditions.

2. Single-Unit Tuning Analysis

Objective:

- Analyze the directional tuning curves for single units.
- Use a two-way ANOVA to assess the effects of reward and direction on firing rates.
- Construct firing rate tuning curves by reward condition.

Required Data Fields:

spiketimesdiff: Neural spike times.
params: For grouping and statistical analysis.

3. Trial-to-Trial Variability Analysis

Objective:

- Compute the Fano Factor (variance/mean firing rate) for each neuron.
- Compare Fano Factor distributions across different reward levels.

Required Data Fields:

spiketimesdiff: Basis for firing rate computation.
trialcodes: For trial grouping.
