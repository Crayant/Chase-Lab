1. Correlation Between Neural Activity and Behavioral Metrics

Objective:

- Compute the correlation between neural activity (e.g., PSTH) and behavioral metrics (e.g., reaction time, success rate).

Required Data Fields:

spiketimesdiff: Neural activity timings.
result: Trial success or failure outcomes.
params: For grouping analysis by task conditions.
