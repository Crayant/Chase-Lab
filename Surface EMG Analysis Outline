1. Directional Tuning of EMG Signals

Objective:

- Perform directional tuning analysis for EMG signals from each muscle and generate tuning curves.
- Use target onset, go cue, and target acquisition times as alignment windows.

Required Data Fields:

spikeinfo: Contains time series of muscle signals.
trialcodes: For extracting trial conditions.

2. EMG Analysis During Delay Phase

Objective:

- Compute the average EMG signal during the delay phase ([-150, 50] ms).
- Perform a two-way ANOVA to evaluate the effects of reward and direction on EMG signals.

Required Data Fields:

spiketimesdiff: For analyzing signals within a specific time window.
params: Includes reward and target conditions.
