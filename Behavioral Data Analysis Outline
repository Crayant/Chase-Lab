1. Success Rates and Failure Modes Analysis

Objective:

- Calculate the success rates of the main task and group them by reward levels (Small, Medium, Large).
- Use bootstrapping to compute confidence intervals for success rates.
- Categorize failure types, including "overshoot" (cursor passes the target) and "undershoot" (cursor fails to reach the target).

Required Data Fields:

trialcodes: To extract task conditions for each trial.
result: To identify whether a trial was successful.
event: To detect the timing of "go cue" and target acquisition.

2. Single-Trial Behavioral Metrics

Objective:

- Peak Speed: Compute the peak cursor speed for each trial.
- Reaction Time: Measure the time from "go cue" to the point where the cursor speed reaches 20% of the peak speed.
- Homing Time: Calculate the time taken for the cursor to cover the last third of the distance to the target and reach the target boundary.
- Off-Axis Error: Measure the cursorâ€™s deviation from the target vector at the time of peak speed.

Required Data Fields:

event: For extracting timing points related to cursor speed changes.
params: To distinguish different task conditions.
